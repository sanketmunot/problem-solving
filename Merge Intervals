Given a set of [low,high] intervals merge the overlapping intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/submissions/

i have first sorted the intervals
added a dummy set to get the last interval (edge case)

time complexity:
sort - nLog(n)
traversal - n

space complexity:
O n+1

def merge(self,intervals):
        intervals.sort()
        intervals.append([-1,-1])
        low,high = intervals[0]
        res = []
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            newLow, newHigh = interval
            if newLow <= high and newLow >= low:
                low = min(low,newLow)
                high = max(high,newHigh)
            else:
                res.append([low, high])
                low, high = interval
        return res
